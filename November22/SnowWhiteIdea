The scene opens with the robots shuffling to work, "whistling" their signature tune and marching single file across stage. 

They then begin "work" using pickaxes to find gems. Maybe three of the robots are in charge of mining and the others locate and transport the gems.

After establishing this work pattern for a minute, there is a conflict! Happy has dropped and shattered a gem! He doesn't think too much of it and quickly goes back to work. 

"But that's not okay, Happy" says Doc. "You need to be accountable for your actions and at least clean up the mess" 

"#@*&!" says Grumpy "He needs to stay longer to make up for the lost gem! What the heck, Happy?!?!" 

Happy reluctantly cleans up the mess and then returns to work. After a moment, Sneezy anounces "The cart *sneeze* is full! Time to go home!" 

Everyone goes back single file. Happy moves to follow and Grumpy glares at him. Doc says, "Now, Grumpy. Just because he made a mistake doesn't mean he should suffer for it. We've all dropped the odd gem or two!"

Grumpy huffs away and heads home, Happy and Doc following closely behind. 

Back at the house, Snow White (AKA Dog Robot) tells the dwarves to get ready for dinner. The dwarves go and, instead of washing up, help each other adjust their screws/polish their components/etc. Once that's done, they gather by the "dinner table". One by one, Snow White gives each dwarf a single bolt that they gobble up. Snow White gives them all a little pat on the head and they all react appropriately "Yum" "Grr" "Yawn" *Cute facial expression from Dopey*

Snow white then proceeds to sing in her best operatic voice a lullaby while the robots all fall asleep. The end.
