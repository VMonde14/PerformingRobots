## Burn Out - The Robot (IN PROGRESS)

# The Concept

In this project my main goal was to create a robot with a certain amount of energy. It would happily complete any task you ask of it as long as its energy was still in stock. Once its energy was completely depleted, it would need to rest, thus refusing to move. 

# The Process

This process was both very frustrating and very rewarding. I started with the Neopixel. First, I created what I call the "base shape" of the energy bar.
