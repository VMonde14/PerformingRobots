**How it was made:**

I used a servo motor with a small pinwheel attachment to form the base of the spinner. I then attached a thin piece of cardboard to that, so it would have a larger surface area, but not much added weight. I built a small shelf for the motor to attach to and then mounted it, as well as the H bridge, to the cardbord with high-tech blue tack. Due to the weight of the motor, I added a piece of cardboard to support the front.

**The Sequence:** 

Pizza Bot 4000 begins confidently. It takes a moment to consider its purpose (to make pizza), and then begins its dutiful spinning. First, it expects sauce. The supreme sauce distribution takes 5 seconds to complete, afterwhich, it pauses once more to allow the head check to prepare the cheese. Again, the cheese is applied for 5 seconds. After that, the chef has 2 seconds to prepare the toppings and 5 seconds to put them on. It is Pizza Bot's job to make sure the toppings are spread evenly on the pizza. This is achieved through its state of the art design and slanted pizza spinner, to allow gravity to be assistant chef in the pizza making world. 

**Difficulties:**

This is truly not my best work. If I wasn't a bit stressed about catching up on work I missed, I would have added LEDs that show when to stop and go as well as a button to start the sequence. However, I decided to submit Pizza Bot as it was since I found its performance delightfully entertaining. 

**So Good!**
