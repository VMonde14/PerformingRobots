The character I’ve chosen is Milton Radner in [“The Weight of Laughter”](https://monologueblogger.com/weight-of-laughter/). Originally, I was going to choose the main character, Boyd, because it was interesting how a “robot” laugh could be the “laughter of America”. Once I read through the script though, I found Radner’s character more interesting to be portrayed by a robot. Mainly, I was interested in his escalation towards the end of the scene and how that might carry undertones of a robot not being able to comprehend laughter as an emotion and also as an emotionless job. When I think of AI, there is often a conversation about how to make robots “understand” emotion and laughter, but what happens when you teach a robot that laughter means joy, and then it meets someone who sees laughter as a job? 

## Technical Features of the actor: 

I imagine the actor would have a speaker to convey his lines as well as eyes of some sort to aid in showing his “emotion”. I also worry about having a moving mouth. I’m not sure if that’s necessary. I think eyes would convey emotion more than a mouth and a mouth would also make it more human-like which I don’t necessarily want. 

In terms of speaking lines, at first I wanted like a noise sensor so it could detect when the other actor was pausing, thus prompting the robot to say its line. But in the script, Radner cuts off Boyd quite a bit, so I don't think that would work. I wonder, instead, if it can detect the amount of time since it spoke its last line (or with the sound detector, if it detects when its co-actor began speaking) and then use that to calculate when it's time to speak. 

An alternative is to use "cue words" like actual actors. When Boyd says "Well I'm certainly happy to help" the word "help" would be a trigger for Radner's next line. The only issue here is that its co-actor would need 100% memorization and precision with his lines. 

## Construction of the actor:

I think the actor would be a literal talking head. In theater classes, you are often scolded for standing in place and just speaking, but in an interview, people often just sit and talk. I am interested in what happens if the actor is just a head, maybe with “hands” of some sort. But I don’t think it should be distinctly humanoid. I like the idea of the robot not understanding aspects of human existence (like most robots haha) but maybe his frustration with Boyd also comes from his lack of ability to laugh or move in the way of humans. 

## Costuming of the Actor:

I would have the actor “dressed” or painted in a stereotypical interview outfit- a suit and tie or something a little formal. But I want the fact that he’s a robot to be prevalent. Maybe there’s wiring sticking out somewhere, or people can see metal underneath the suit. 

## Sequences of Movement: 

I would have the primary movement be in arms and eyes. Perhaps an eye roll could be executed or the narrowing of his eyes. Maybe eyebrows would be important for this as well! As for his arms, it would be cool to have them move as he talks, maybe going up and down or clasped in his “lap” and responding to different emotions.
