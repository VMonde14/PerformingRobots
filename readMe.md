## Mr. Highfive: A Proposal

I first got the idea to make Mr. Highfive after thinking about the Vector Robot by Anki https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/pages/meet-vector

The overall idea is a robot who insists on getting a highfive from whoever is nearby. If you give, the robot is happy. If you don't, the robot is angry. 

This week I worked a lot with the Neopixel. I had a lot of trouble with it at first. When I called on a specific pixel number, it seemed almost random which one would turn off. If I asked for pixel 3, maybe it would turn off. But then if I asked it to be white or red, a completely different pixel would respond. I'm not sure if this is because specific diodes have specific color assignments? But I've seen them all in the full range of RGB colors. I was extremely confused. 

Then something changed? I honestly can't say what I did to fix it. It, again, seemed random. I decided to make an eye to convey the emotions of the robot. I started by making the entire matrix white. I then had to pinpoint specific pixel rows and columns that would change color. 

I do think my code is a bit too long. I think there's probably a way to make the eye in a more consise way, but I can't think of it right now.
